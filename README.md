# BEMM459_RDBMS_NoSQL

For code associated with BEMM459, please click the relevant folder (code is organised by weeks).
As you will be learning databases, you will work with relational and NoSQL database software, which have already been pre-installed and made available through Exeter's Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD). Binder or other hosting platforms will not provide you access to these databases or persistent storage. Therefore, please only use WVD.
